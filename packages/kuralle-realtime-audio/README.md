Provider-native realtime audio for Kuralle — speech-to-speech voice agents powered by Gemini Live, OpenAI Realtime, or xAI Grok Realtime, with Kuralle keeping tool, flow, and handoff authority.

## Install

```bash
npm install @kuralle-agents/realtime-audio
```

Peer dependencies:

```bash
npm install @kuralle-agents/core ai zod
```

## What it does

Unlike the cascaded path in `@kuralle-agents/livekit-plugin` (STT → LLM → TTS), provider-native realtime sends raw audio directly to the model and receives audio back in a single connection — lower latency, no transcript round-trip.

Whole-answer content gates are **advisory** on native realtime audio. The provider speaks audio as it generates it, before any Kuralle gate runs, so a blocking gate cannot un-speak audio already played — it emits a `safety-*` event and speaks a correction utterance (post-hoc). The reliable controls on native realtime are **input-side gating** (pre-turn policies) and **tool authority** (tools return data, not conversational text). On the **cascaded** substrate, by contrast, Kuralle controls the emission boundary and the gate is preventive.

- **`VoiceEngine`** — call acceptor. Accepts incoming audio connections and creates per-call `VoiceCallSession` workers that bridge a transport to the chosen provider.
- **`VoiceCallSession`** / **`RealtimeCallWorker`** — per-call lifecycle: connects to the provider, routes tool calls through Kuralle runtime, manages session state.
- **`GeminiLiveSession`** — thin wrapper around `@google/genai` `live.connect()`; manages the WebSocket to Gemini, PCM audio encoding, tool dispatch, and session resumption.
- **`OpenAIRealtimeClient`** — OpenAI Realtime API client.
- **`CloudflareRealtimeAdapter`** — plugs any `RealtimeAudioClient` into Kuralle runtime authority inside a Cloudflare Durable Object.
- **`CloudflareGeminiLiveClient`**, **`CloudflareOpenAIRealtimeClient`**, **`CloudflareXAIGrokRealtimeClient`** — Cloudflare Workers variants.
- **`createGeminiClientFactory`** / **`createOpenAIClientFactory`** — provider client factories.
- **`voiceAgentToRuntimeAgent`** — converts a `VoiceAgentConfig` to a standard Kuralle agent config.

## Usage

```typescript
import { VoiceEngine, createGeminiClientFactory } from '@kuralle-agents/realtime-audio';

const engine = new VoiceEngine({
  agents: [
    {
      id: 'support',
      name: 'Support Agent',
      instructions: 'You are a support agent.',
      voice: 'Charon',
      tools: { /* Kuralle tool definitions */ },
    },
  ],
  defaultAgentId: 'support',
  modelClientFactory: createGeminiClientFactory({
    apiKey: process.env.GOOGLE_API_KEY!,
    model: 'gemini-2.5-flash-preview-native-audio',
  }),
});

// Accept a call from any transport (WebSocket, LiveKit, etc.)
const session = await engine.acceptCall({
  callId: crypto.randomUUID(),
  transport: myTransportSession, // implements TransportSession
});

await session.start();
```
